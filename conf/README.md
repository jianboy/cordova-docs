# Jekyll Configuration

This folder contains different configuration files for the Jekyll build, which is triggered via `gulp build` and similar commands (`gulp serve` etc.).

Files present after checkout:

- `_config.yml` is the main Jekyll config file
- `_version.yml` defines the latest version of the docs
- `_dev.yml` is used for default builds
- `_prod.yml` is used when the `--prod` option is used for the build
- `_nodocs.yml` is used when the `--nodocs` option is used for the build

Some files are generated by the build process itself:

- `_defaults.yml` defines different config values for different parts of the docs

To learn more about how to control the build with these files, have a look at: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/
